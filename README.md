# **CYBR371-A1**

**Assignment 1 for CYBR371**

- This was my first assignment for CYBR371-System and Network security.
 
- My shell/bash scripts are very messy as this was my first attempt writing shell/bash scripts.

# _**FUTURE STUDENTS DOING CYBR371:**_

If you are viewing my scripts to do the first assignment for this course, I hope it makes sense and is useful for guidance and referencing.

- My .sh scripts are a complete mess and you can probably find better and more efficient ways of doing this assignment.
  Please, only look at my scripts if you are really stuck. I do not want to cause you any headaches trying to reverse-engineer my .sh scripts. 
  
- Please do **NOT** copy-paste/plagarise my code. You will get penalised by _**ECS**_ and _**VUW**_.

# _**OTHER VIEWERS**_

This code was written in a way that anyone that is new to writing scripts in linux can understand it. 
Keep in mind, this was my first attempt at writing shell/bash scripts and I plan on becoming better 
at writing scripts in the future.

- _**So, I'm sorry to any advanced programmers out there looking at my crap script code. :)**_
